## About Me ##

Hello! My name is Duncan Katzel, and I am a User Experience Design Student at Wilfred Laurier University. Welcome to my portfolio!<br/>

When designing something, I always have a mindset of what my users would like to see, and how each product can be the best version of itself. I love collaborating with others on ideas as I believe that it is the best way to test theories and obtain feedback on your own ideas. I believe that I have the qualities of a supporter, in which I help other's ideas come to life and build on what they might not have thought about for their design.Â <br/>

Some of my personal hobbies include: Rugby and Martial Arts.
