## OneMarket Project ##

In my first year of the User Experience Design program at Wilfred Laurier University, the "Design Thinking I" course asked us to help clients with their design problems. The client of our group asked us to give ideas on how the OneMarket mall in the heart of brantford can be a community based mall as oppose to a student hub. <br/>

We conducted research on students, young families, and creative professionals to better understand our target audience. We asked them questions like: "What do you like to do at a mall?" or "what are some criticisms of brantford?" We also asked a little bit of personal information like where they live, in order to properly understand their viewpoint. <br/>

We ended up asking the question: "How might we integrate tudents, businesses, and community into the OneMarket?", to make the OneMarket a place that everyone can enjoy. We decided to create a website that will help our clients persuade businesses to set up inside OneMarket. <br/>
