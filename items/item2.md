Maker Lab I Course

In the Maker Lab I course, groups were asked to create 2 different products, with guidelines of certain objectives we had to meet.<br/>

The first project asked us to create a product that "hacks" the conventional use of a cardboard box. For this we created an Isolation Helmet for people who have trouble concentrating in populated areas, or for people with social anxiety, to get away from the world for a bit. <br/>

The second project asked us to create a DIY product, that also deals with a social issue of choice. For this, my group and I created a Naloxone Dispenser, that can be put in areas of choice that can prevent opioid abusers from overdosing and dying.

For more information, I have created a [Separate Portfolio](https://duncankatzel.wixsite.com/makerlab1) on Wix.
